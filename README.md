# CampusQueue
# 🚀 CampusQueue
**Real-time occupancy & queue tracker for TCD campus spaces.**  
Live Buttery/Dining Hall queues, library seats, study spots. End lunch rush chaos!

## Problem (Real TCD Pain)
- Buttery queues: 20min–1hr waits daily
- Library: Constant seat hunting, stewards patrol desks  
- No live status = wasted time walking to full spots

## Solution 
Mobile web app: QR check-in/out → live heatmap + "ETA: 12 mins" predictions + alerts.

**Hackathon MVP:** Admin panel simulates live data for judges.
